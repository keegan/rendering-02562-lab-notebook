<h4>Custom scene (diamond)</h4>
I loaded in a diamond shaped mesh and added an emissive torus inside the glass ball as a sort of light bulb.
I increased the transmission of the glass ball to 20% to let some light shine out to give interesting shine on the diamond.

The diamond has a physically realistic index of refraction of 2.4
