    The BspTree.js script sorts a trimesh into a BSP tree and loads that tree into storage buffers for access from the WGSL shader.  
    The build_bsp_tree(drawingInfo, device, buffers) function takes the drawingInfo (collection of data describing the trimesh and its faces' materials).
    To create the BSP tree, the script starts by drawing a bounding box containing all triangles of the mesh.
    It then recursively tries splitting each bounding box into two halves, testing along the 3 axes and at 4 different positions (1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5) for each axis
    to find the dividing plane to bisect the bounding box into two bounding boxes with the lowest
    score on the surface area heuristic (product of box surface area and # of triangles contained for the left and right boxes). It continues this process,
    bisecting boxes into smaller ones, until either hitting the max tree depth of 20 or getting the number of triangles inside the box below the max of 4.
    The resultant axis-aligned BSP tree is then loaded into storage buffers for access from WGSL.
